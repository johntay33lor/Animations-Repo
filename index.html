                <h2>My Go-to Quote</h2>
                <p><q>The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands
                    in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he 
                    stands at times of challenge and controversy.</q></p>
                    <p>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p><br>

                    This quote holds a special place in my heart, hence it being
                    my <em>go to quote.</em> This quote is a reminder for me that
                    it is important to be able to function, even when not in a 
                    comfortable situation. I have this quote tattooed on my arm 
                    as a reminder.</p>

                <h2>Quote to Keep Pushing</h2>
                <p><q>Don't stop when you're <em>tired</em>, stop when you're
                    <strong>done</strong>.</q></p>
                    <p>Grandfather</p><br>

                <p class="info">
                    I remember my grandfather telling me this so many times
                    when I was a child. He used to always tell me that it was
                    easy to quit when you're tired, never take the easy route.
                    I remember this especially on days I feel too tired to do anything</p>

                <h2>Quote to Work Hard</h2>
                <p><q>Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard</q></p>
                <p>Football Coach</p><br>

                <p class="info">
                    My high school football coach loved this quote so much
                    that he had it placed on every locker in the locker room.
                    This quote means a lot to me because of the truth it holds.
                    I remember this to make sure that another person can ever out work me.</p>
